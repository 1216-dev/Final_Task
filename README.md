# Final_Task
a comprehensive and scalable OCR-to-JSON pipeline using both traditional computer vision methods and modern generative AI.

# 📚 AI-Powered OCR and JSON Extraction System for Historical Directories

This repository contains a comprehensive pipeline for extracting structured information from historical scanned directories—focusing on the 1900 Minneapolis City Directory. It combines traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with generative AI (Gemini 1.5 Flash) to produce high-quality, structured JSON outputs.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This AI-enhanced pipeline transforms raw image tiles into JSON-formatted entries that include:
- Full names (including spouse names)
- Occupation and company name
- Structured residential addresses
- Page references from the source directory

---

## 🎯 Objectives and Deliverables

- ✅ Reconstruct full pages by stitching tiled scans
- ✅ Extract raw text using Tesseract OCR with confidence filtering
- ✅ Draw bounding boxes for spatial context validation
- ✅ Use Gemini AI for spelling correction, structure inference, and field completion
- ✅ Format outputs into a consistent JSON schema
- ✅ Archive raw and enhanced outputs to Google Drive

---

## 🧠 Theoretical Basis

Historical directories often feature:
- Faded print
- Multi-column formats
- Abbreviated street/occupational terms
- Inconsistent layouts

Traditional OCR struggles with these, resulting in low fidelity. Gemini 1.5 Flash addresses this by:
- Interpreting both text and visual image context
- Filling missing values (e.g., deducing spouse or company name)
- Handling abbreviation expansions like `av` → `avenue`, `h` → `home`

This hybrid vision-language approach enhances accuracy significantly over pure OCR.

## 🔄 Workflow

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **1. Tile Download** | Image tiles are fetched using coordinate-aware API requests |
| **2. Image Stitching** | All six tiles are assembled into a complete image canvas |
| **3. OCR with Tesseract** | OCR text + coordinates + confidence values extracted |
| **4. Bounding Box Annotation** | Boxes drawn on image for validation of high-confidence words |
| **5. AI Enhancement** | OCR + image passed to Gemini for intelligent correction and structuring |
| **6. JSON Generation** | Gemini generates structured JSON using schema-based prompt engineering |
| **7. Output Saving** | Organized folder system for all final artifacts |

## 🛠️ Key Techniques

- ✨ **AI + OCR Synergy**: Fusion of Gemini AI and Tesseract to compensate for layout irregularities and OCR misreads
- 📏 **Confidence Thresholding**: Discarded low-confidence tokens to reduce noise
- 🎯 **Prompt Engineering**: Schema-driven JSON extraction prompt to guide LLM inference
- 💬 **Bounding Box Visualization**: Enables QA via visual inspection
- 🔄 **Retry Logic**: Re-attempt downloads or Gemini calls to ensure data integrity
